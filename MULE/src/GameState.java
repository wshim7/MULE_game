/**
 * The GameState class creates a static singleton object which can be accessed
 * at any point in the program; it keeps track of the current state of the game.
 * 
 * MENU: The game is either in the initial setup menu or is paused. WAITING: The
 * game is in gameplay mode, but is waiting for the current player to signal
 * that he is ready to start his turn. PLAYING_MAP: The game is in regular
 * gameplay mode on the overall map, i.e. current player can move around map and
 * place mules or catch the wampus. PLAYING_TOWN: The game is in gameplay mode
 * in the town, i.e. current player can move around town and spend money or
 * gamble. LAND GRANT: The game is in land grant mode, i.e. players are each
 * choosing a plot of land on the map. AUCTION: The game is in auction mode,
 * i.e. auction screen is displayed and players are bargaining for
 * resources/land with the store.
